Without any competition, the biogas plant produces more CO2 than the methanol plant needs, so the dual is 0.

Alamia on his paper penalised grid emissions and natural gas emission with a co2 tax, so you pay spot price,ref + tarrif + emission tax

Alamia

Dogan input:
Remove biomethane from the demand and treat biogas plant as a CO2 source for the methanol production. Then the CO2 duals are only affected by the methanol (thus CO2) demand.
Then we can sell whatever biomethane it occurs as a side revenue to the plant at a fixed price.
