Without any competition, the biogas plant produces more CO2 than the methanol plant needs, so the dual is 0.

Alamia on his paper penalised grid emissions and natural gas emission with a co2 tax, so you pay spot price,ref + tarrif + emission tax

Dogan input:
Remove biomethane from the demand and treat biogas plant as a CO2 source for the methanol production. Then the CO2 duals are only affected by the methanol (thus CO2) demand.
Then we can sell whatever biomethane it occurs as a side revenue to the plant at a fixed price.

The estimated cost for biogas is reported to be in the range of 2.6 – 3.21 DKK/Nm3 (400-490 DKK/MWh)

DGC has recently investigated the cost for upgrading, and the cost for larger plants was found to be approx. 0.6 DKK/Nm3 CH4 (4). Adding this cost to the 
cost for biogas results in a biomethane cost of 4.6 – 5.5 DKK/Nm3 CH4 (460 – 550 DKK/MWh) dependent on the type of organic material used and production setup.


What if I add CO2 compression before methanol plant and after biogas so that i can see the cost maybe I can see the non zero cost there
In general, model everything related to CO2 so i can see the cost occuring.

Scenario 1 (Baseline): Methanol w/ UC 40% min 90% RR
Scenario 2: Methanol no UC
Scenario 3: Baseline + no storage
Scenario 4: Baseline + Biogas constant production
Scenario 5: Baseline + Selling biogas w/ a price
Scenario 6: Baseline + Hydrogen selling at 3 Euro/kg
Scenario 7: Baseline + SC4 + SC5 + SC6
